These some of the features we think make us unique.  We try to focus development on features that aren't already available elsewhere for free.

* Free public match replay parsing.  Most similar services offer this as a premium feature.  Replay parsing allows us to extract much more data from games than the API offers.

* Open source.  We keep our code open source, so anyone can help contribute, or use our code for their own projects.  We also have downloads of player and match data for users to do their own analysis.

* Visualizations.  We do some pretty cool visualizations of player match data, such as histograms, heatmaps, and word clouds.
