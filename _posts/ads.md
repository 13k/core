Today, we're bringing back ads to YASP.

While we've ran YASP without ads for over half a year, our costs have continued to
rise, making donations alone unsustainable in the long term. With ads, we hope to bring in at 
least $500 a month which will considerably help us with our server costs.

We'll still keep, and need to keep, [Cheese](/carry) around. Ads alone also won't cover our costs. But remain commited to
providing free stats for all our users. To incentivise donations, as soon as we've reached the monthly cheese goal,
ads will disappear for everyone for the rest of the month.

Don't like this change? We understand! If they bother you, feel free to use an

Thanks for your continued support!
