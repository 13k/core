Your one-true-love has gotten even sexier. Today, we're rolling out a few hot, new features:

* [Replay uploads](/request) (are back!): Upload your replays to see the parsed stats on YASP.
  * This replay data will be temporarily stored on YASP to keep the costs lower
  * This will even support private lobbies!
* [Picks](/picks): Ever wonder how well certain combinations of heroes do? Now you can see.
* [Paypal](/carry): You gotta get your Valentine something nice. Now you can through Paypal.

On this loveliest of holidays, we hope you spend it with us ;)

Happy Dota!
