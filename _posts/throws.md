Introducing advanced analysis of throws.

<!--more-->

With parsed data of all our users, we're able to analyze really what causes a throw.

After many sleepless nights, the YASP team has figured out exactly that, and have developed a new metric: the 322 Level.

Named in honor of Solo and his valiant attempt at revolutionizing the monetization of the professional Dota 2 scene, this statistic
consists of many variables that only YASP's parsed data can provide. Here are a few of the aggregations and analyses included:

* Number of couriers bought and fed
* Aegis denies
* Percentage of Divine Rapiers delivered to enemy base
* Techies picks
* Aggregate number of legs on team
* Allusions to throwing in all chat
* Similarity level of all chat to Twitch chat
* Number of times "space created" was said

We hope you all enjoy this new statistic.

And happy April Fools.
