There are a few things YASP offers that we believe to be unique.  We also believe in deduplication, so we try to focus on features that aren't already done by others.
* Free public match replay parsing.  Other sites offer public match parsing for a price, or parse only professional matches for free.
* Open source.  We keep our code open source, so anyone can help contribute, or use our code for their own data analysis.
* Better querying.  We offer a flexible and powerful querying tool so that users can filter/extract interesting stats from their own match data.
* Visualizations.  We do some pretty cool visualizations of player match data.
