This site is run as a side project of a couple of college students.
As such, it doesn't need to turn a profit.
We're also happy to share our knowledge with the community by completely open-sourcing the entire site and stack we run it on.

Here's how we're able to keep paying the server bills:
* Donations.  We sell <a href='/carry' target="_blank">Cheese</a> to users who want to help support the site.
* Ads. Running these helps subsidize server costs.
* Efficient design.  The site is separated into components that we can scale individually.  We end up not paying as much for resources we don't need.
* Reducing load.  We only parse the matches of users who have visited recently, in order to conserve resources for those who actually use the service.
* Volunteer developers.  We don't need to pay employees as all developers are volunteers contributing in their free time.

Anything that's left, we pay out-of-pocket!
