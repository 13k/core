We've been getting a lot of questions about how MMR tracking works now, and we're sorry for not making it clear.
When Valve rolled out Source 2, they changed how MMR is displayed. Instead of only your friends being able
to view your MMR, it's now only viewable if you add it to your profile card. It will then be publically viewable.

**If you want YASP to track your MMR, you must add MMR to your profile card.** If you added a YASP MMR tracker
to your friends list before, it can be removed. It doesn't do anything anymore.

The [distributions](/distributions) tab displays aggregates the data of all the players we have in our database who have MMR
in their profile. While this data may be a biased sample, it gives us a snapshot into how MMR is distributed across the Dota
community.
