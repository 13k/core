By adding a rating tracker to your friends list, it will automatically get your MMR after every ranked game and present the results to you right here on YASP!

How do we do it?  When you add one of our accounts to your friends list, the account is now able to view your MMR.
When you complete a game, YASP detects it and requests a lookup of your latest MMR.  We save this data and update your graph.
