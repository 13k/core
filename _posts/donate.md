You should donate!  It will make us happy.

YASP does its best to minimize server costs through efficient algorithmic decisions.
However, the remaining costs continue to be subsidized out-of-pocket.  

With the new "Cheese" feature, we give our contributors some swag points, and help out with YASP's hosting costs all at once!

Community contributions would be greatly appreciated!
