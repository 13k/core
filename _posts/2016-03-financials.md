We started YASP with one goal in mind: free Dota 2 statistics for everyone who wants them.

So far, we've done a pretty good job.

* 100,000+ YASP users, 20,000+ active
* 40,000+ parsed matches a day

And we've done it without ads or subscription accounts. We've ran completely from generous
user donations.

But as the number of users and matches has grown, so has server costs. Meanwhile, revenue has stagnated.

Last month, February, we spent $987 on servers on $578 of net donations ($638 total, we generally lose ~10% from fees).

This month, we're looking at server costs of about $1300, meaning we need around $1400 in donations to break even.
While it's a big increase, there are a lot of good reasons for it:
  * Increased stability
  * To support an influx of new users
  * Scaling up our hard drives for our ever increasing data
  * And preparing for cool new features coming in April

To be clear, we operate completely not-for-profit. All income we get we invest straight back into hosting YASP. All
devs, team members, and contributors receive no compensation.

We want to keep YASP ads free for as long as possible. We believe our users and their data shouldn't be products!

**So we need your help to keep YASP running. If everyone who read this gave $1, we'd reach our goal in half a day.**

Thanks,

The YASP team
